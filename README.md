**_ OVERVIEW OF JAVA COMPILER _**

This compiler project is designed to transform high-level programming constructs into executable bytecode, showcasing a deep understanding of compiler design principles. Built in Java, the system emphasizes precision, efficiency, and robust error handling through its integrated Lexer, Parser, and AST Visualization components.

**_ INSTRUCTIONS _**

- Starting the Compiler:
  Initiate the compilation process using the `make run` command.
  The compiler will prompt you to select a source file for compilation.

- Selecting a Source File:
  Follow the prompts to choose a source file.
  The compiler will then process the selected file, generate and display the AST graphically, and report any errors encountered during compilation.
